# Chat App

## Introduction

Hosting: https://chat-app1158.netlify.app/

This project serves as a basic real-time chat application. This web app makes use of the React framework and consists of a home page in which the users enter arbitrary usernames with a specific chat room ID's to connect with each other. Once two or more users have connected to the same chat room ID, they are able to send and recieve chat messages in real-time. The technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, socket.io, and React. The site can improve by elevating the general styling of the home and chat pages as well as integrating user authentication.

## User stories:
- As a project manager I want to access a chat app so that I can communicate with my team on a regular basis.

- As a parent I want to create a chatroom with multiple users so that I can stay in contact with all of my children.
